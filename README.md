# AWS DAX SDK for Go

aws-dax-go is the official AWS DAX SDK for the Go programming language. https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax

Checkout our [release notes](https://github.com/aws/aws-dax-go/releases) for
information about the latest bug fixes, updates, and features added to the SDK.

## Getting started
The best way to get started working with the SDK is to use go get to add the SDK
to your Go Workspace manually.

    go get github.com/aws/aws-dax-go


## Making API requests
This example shows how you can use the AWS DAX SDK to make an API request.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/aws/aws-dax-go/dax"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/dynamodb"
)

func main() {
	
	cfg := dax.DefaultConfig()
	cfg.HostPorts = []string{"dax://mycluster.frfx8h.clustercfg.dax.usw2.amazonaws.com:8111"}
	cfg.Region = "us-west-2"
	client, err := dax.New(cfg)

	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Errorf("unable to initialize client %v", err))
	}
	
	
	// Connection to a secure cluster
	secureEndpoint := "daxs://mycluster.frfx8h.clustercfg.dax.usw2.amazonaws.com"
	secureCfg := dax.DefaultConfig()
	secureCfg.HostPorts = []string{secureEndpoint}
	secureCfg.Region = "us-west-2"
	
	//WARN: Skip hostname verification of TLS connections. 
	//The default is to perform hostname verification, setting this to True will skip verification. 
	//Be sure you understand the implication of doing so, which is the inability to authenticate
	//the cluster that you are connecting to.
	secureCfg.SkipHostnameVerification = false
	
	// DialContext is an optional field in Config.
	// If DialContext is being set in Config for a secure/ encrypted cluster, then use dax.SecureDialContext to 
	// return DialContext. An example of how DailContext can be set using dax.SecureDialContext is shown below.
	secureCfg.DialContext = func(ctx context.Context, network string, address string) (net.Conn, error) {
		//    fmt.Println("Write your custom logic here")
		dialCon, err := dax.SecureDialContext(secureEndpoint, secureCfg.SkipHostnameVerification)
		if err != nil {
			panic(fmt.Errorf("secure dialcontext creation failed %v", err))
		}
		return dialCon(ctx, network, address)
	}
	secureClient, err := dax.New(secureCfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Errorf("unable to initialize client %v", err))
	}
	fmt.Println("secure client created", secureClient)
	
	

	input := &dynamodb.PutItemInput{
		TableName: aws.String("TryDaxGoTable"),
		Item: map[string]*dynamodb.AttributeValue{
			"pk":    {S: aws.String("mykey")},
			"sk":    {N: aws.String("0")},
			"value": {S: aws.String("myvalue")},
		},
	}

	output, err := client.PutItem(input)
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Errorf("unable to make request %v", err))
	}

	fmt.Println("Output: ", output)
}
```
